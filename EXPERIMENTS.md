# Experiments

The project tracks strategy variations as "experiments". The prefix "A" indicates an
autonomous idea generated by an AI assistant.

## A1 – Dynamic TQQQ Baseline
Baseline dynamic allocation strategy with temperature and momentum filters.  This is
the default behavior when running `strategy_tqqq_reserve.py` without specifying an
experiment.

- **CAGR**: ~29.70% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A2 – Cold Leverage Boost
Adds a "cold leverage" rule that increases TQQQ exposure by 20% (capped at 120%) when
market temperature is below 0.8, interest rates are under 5%, and the 22‑day return is
non‑negative.  This leverages the cash reserve during deep value periods.

- **CAGR**: ~30.58% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A3 – Deep Cold Turbo Boost
Builds on A2 by adding a second leverage tier. When temperature drops below 0.75,
interest rates are under 4%, and the 22‑day return is at least 2%, exposure gains an
extra 20% (capped at 140%). This aims to capture strong rebounds during extreme
discounts.

- **CAGR**: ~31.17% (through 2025‑01‑10)
