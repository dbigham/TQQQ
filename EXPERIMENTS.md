# Experiments

The project tracks strategy variations as "experiments". The prefix "A" indicates an
autonomous idea generated by an AI assistant.

## A1 – Dynamic TQQQ Baseline
Baseline dynamic allocation strategy with temperature and momentum filters.  This is
the default behavior when running `strategy_tqqq_reserve.py` without specifying an
experiment.

- **CAGR**: ~29.70% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A2 – Cold Leverage Boost
Adds a "cold leverage" rule that increases TQQQ exposure by 20% (capped at 120%) when
market temperature is below 0.8, interest rates are under 5%, and the 22‑day return is
non‑negative.  This leverages the cash reserve during deep value periods.

- **CAGR**: ~30.58% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A3 – Deep Cold Turbo Boost
Builds on A2 by adding a second leverage tier. When temperature drops below 0.75,
interest rates are under 4%, and the 22‑day return is at least 2%, exposure gains an
extra 20% (capped at 140%). This aims to capture strong rebounds during extreme
discounts.

- **CAGR**: ~31.17% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A4 – Momentum Overdrive
Adds a "hot momentum" layer that increases exposure by 20% during strong,
broad uptrends when temperature and rates are acceptable, with an additional
20% tier for exceptional rallies (capped at 160%/180% total). A momentum stop
reverts to the baseline allocation if short‑term returns weaken.

- **CAGR**: ~31.36% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A5 – Macro Risk-Off Overlay
Builds on A4 by layering in a macro filter. When the yield curve spread drops
below –0.2 **and** the credit spread exceeds 2.15, TQQQ exposure is slashed to
0% until conditions improve, aiming to avoid high‑risk regimes.

- **CAGR**: ~32.16% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A6 – Realized-Volatility Tilt
Adds a rule that boosts exposure when 22-day realized volatility is very low
and recent returns are non-negative. In practice this tilt rarely triggers and
slightly reduces long-term returns.

- **CAGR**: ~29.51% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A7 – Faster Re-entries
Introduces intra-cycle rebalances when the target allocation exceeds the
current allocation by 12% and at least six trading days have passed since the
last rebalance. This keeps the strategy from waiting a full 22 days to buy
after sharp recoveries.

- **CAGR**: ~33.23% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A8 – Relaxed Buy Blocks
Loosens the momentum-based buy blocks when the market temperature is extremely
low. The more permissive thresholds provide only a marginal improvement over
the baseline and trail A7.

- **CAGR**: ~32.79% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A9 – Partial Macro Risk Positioning
Keeps 40% exposure during macro risk-off regimes instead of moving entirely to
cash. This recovers some upside but also reintroduces drawdown exposure,
resulting in a net reduction in CAGR relative to A7.

- **CAGR**: ~32.53% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A10 – Momentum Overdrive
Makes the hot-momentum overlay more aggressive with larger boosts and higher
caps. The added leverage during rallies increases churn without improving
long-run growth.

- **CAGR**: ~32.78% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A11 – Cold-Leverage Surge (Target 35% CAGR)
Further increases the cold-leverage boost and allows limited extra exposure
even when recent returns are mildly negative. Combined with faster re-entries,
this pushes the strategy past the 35% CAGR milestone.

- **CAGR**: ~35.32% (through 2025‑01‑10)
