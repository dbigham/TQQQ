# Experiments

The project tracks strategy variations as "experiments". The prefix "A" indicates an
autonomous idea generated by an AI assistant. By default the CLI runs the best-known
configuration, which is currently **A36 – High-Leverage Ramp**, delivering ~42.68% CAGR
through 2025‑01‑10.

## A1 – Dynamic TQQQ Baseline
Baseline dynamic allocation strategy with temperature and momentum filters.  This was
the original default behavior and remains available via `--experiment A1`.

- Uses the [leverage replication mix](docs/leverage_exposure_replication.md) to
  deploy unlevered capital instead of TQQQ whenever the target allocation is at
  or below 100%, reducing volatility drag and financing costs.
- **CAGR**: ~30.43% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A1g - Global Baseline Optimiser
Re-tunes the original A1 heuristics with a global search across 100 tracked symbols. The optimiser adjusts the temperature allocation curve, momentum filters, and rate taper while disabling the crash derisk rule. On the combined dataset the updated configuration continues to lift average CAGR versus the A1 baseline while retaining the simple monthly rebalance cadence.

- **CAGR**: varies by symbol; see `python optimize_a1_global.py` for the full table

## GOOG2x – Google 2x Baseline Optimiser
Builds directly on the A1g heuristics but re-optimises the anchors, momentum
thresholds, and rate taper specifically for Alphabet (GOOGL) while simulating a
2x leveraged sleeve (matching products such as GGLL). The focused search lifts
GOOGL’s simulated CAGR to roughly **65.9%** with a 2x sleeve, compared with
~42% for the unmodified A1g parameters at the same leverage. The configuration
can be reproduced with `python optimize_leveraged_symbol.py --symbol GOOGL --leverage 2.0`.

- **CAGR**: ~66.14% on GOOGL with 2x leverage (through 2025‑09‑19)


## GOOG2x.b – Google 2x Capped Sleeve
Clones the GOOG2X parameters but caps temperature anchors at 100% allocation so the
strategy never borrows beyond the 2x product itself. Invoke with
--experiment GOOG2X_B (aliases: GOOG2XB, GOOG2X.B).

- **CAGR**: ~47.90% on GOOGL with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## TESLA2x – Tesla 2x Baseline Optimiser
Runs the generalised leveraged optimiser against Tesla (TSLA) and a 2x sleeve
to better match geared products like TSLL. Tesla’s momentum characteristics
differ markedly from the Nasdaq baseline, so the optimiser leans into deeper
temperature discounts while keeping a higher minimum allocation when the market
heats up. Invoke it with `python optimize_leveraged_symbol.py --symbol TSLA --leverage 2.0`.

- **CAGR**: ~94.34% on TSLA with 2x leverage (through 2025‑09‑19)


## TESLA2x.b – Tesla 2x Capped Sleeve
Shares the TESLA2X filters but limits the deployment curve to 100% so the
portfolio never borrows on top of the 2x instrument. Run with
--experiment TESLA2X_B (aliases: TESLA2XB, TESLA2X.B).

- **CAGR**: ~79.76% on TSLA with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## TESLA2x.b.2 – Tesla 2x Manual Temperature Anchor
Builds on TESLA2x.b but pins the constant-growth curve to a 42% annual rate
and enforces a temperature of 1.26 on 2025‑09‑18. The manual anchor keeps the
temperature series aligned with that future reference point instead of relying
on the iterative best fit while respecting the 100% cap on the leveraged
sleeve. Invoke it with `--experiment TESLA2X_B2` (aliases: TESLA2XB2,
TESLA2X.B2, TESLA2X.B.2, TESLA2x.b.2).

- **CAGR**: ~83.28% on TSLA with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## CRM2x – Salesforce 2x Baseline Optimiser
Applies the leveraged optimiser to Salesforce (CRM) while emulating a 2x sleeve
similar to geared single-stock ETFs. CRM’s steadier trend profile lets the
search keep a relatively high mid-temperature allocation while leaning on a
modest rate taper to control leverage costs. The tuned configuration lifts the
2x CAGR from roughly 30.5% under the baseline A1g settings to just under 36.8%.
Recreate the parameters with `python optimize_leveraged_symbol.py --symbol CRM --leverage 2.0`.

- **CAGR**: ~36.49% on CRM with 2x leverage (through 2025‑09‑19)


## CRM2x.b – Salesforce 2x Capped Sleeve
Uses the CRM2X tuning but clamps the allocation curve at 100%, matching an
unlevered capital base while still trading a 2x CRM product. Call it via
--experiment CRM2X_B (aliases: CRM2XB, CRM2X.B).

- **CAGR**: ~35.43% on CRM with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## NVO2x - Novo Nordisk 2x Capped Sleeve
Adapts the leveraged framework to Novo Nordisk (NVO) with a 2x synthetic sleeve while clamping the temperature
anchors at 100% so the strategy never borrows beyond the product. Invoke with `--experiment NVO2X` (alias `NVO2x`).

- **CAGR**: ~26.72% on NVO with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## NVO2x.2 - Novo Nordisk 2x Optimised Sleeve
Builds on NVO2x with a deeper parameter search that tilts the allocation curve, momentum gates, and rate taper to
maximise simulated CAGR while retaining the 100% cap. Run via `--experiment NVO2X_2` (aliases `NVO2X.2`, `NVO2x.2`).

- **CAGR**: ~27.24% on NVO with 2x leverage (through 2025-09-19)

## A2 – Cold Leverage Boost
Adds a "cold leverage" rule that increases TQQQ exposure by 20% (capped at 120%) when
market temperature is below 0.8, interest rates are under 5%, and the 22‑day return is
non‑negative.  This leverages the cash reserve during deep value periods.

- **CAGR**: ~31.10% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A3 – Deep Cold Turbo Boost
Builds on A2 by adding a second leverage tier. When temperature drops below 0.75,
interest rates are under 4%, and the 22‑day return is at least 2%, exposure gains an
extra 20% (capped at 140%). This aims to capture strong rebounds during extreme
discounts.

- **CAGR**: ~31.14% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A4 – Momentum Overdrive
Adds a "hot momentum" layer that increases exposure by 20% during strong,
broad uptrends when temperature and rates are acceptable, with an additional
20% tier for exceptional rallies (capped at 160%/180% total). A momentum stop
reverts to the baseline allocation if short‑term returns weaken.

- **CAGR**: ~31.74% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A5 – Macro Risk-Off Overlay
Builds on A4 by layering in a macro filter. When the yield curve spread drops
below –0.2 **and** the credit spread exceeds 2.15, TQQQ exposure is slashed to
0% until conditions improve, aiming to avoid high‑risk regimes.

- **CAGR**: ~32.41% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A6 – Realized-Volatility Tilt
Adds a rule that boosts exposure when 22-day realized volatility is very low
and recent returns are non-negative. In practice this tilt rarely triggers and
slightly reduces long-term returns.

- **CAGR**: ~31.40% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A7 – Faster Re-entries
Introduces intra-cycle rebalances when the target allocation exceeds the
current allocation by 12% and at least six trading days have passed since the
last rebalance. This keeps the strategy from waiting a full 22 days to buy
after sharp recoveries.

- **CAGR**: ~33.63% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A8 – Relaxed Buy Blocks
Loosens the momentum-based buy blocks when the market temperature is extremely
low. The more permissive thresholds provide only a marginal improvement over
the baseline and trail A7.

- **CAGR**: ~33.13% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A9 – Partial Macro Risk Positioning
Keeps 40% exposure during macro risk-off regimes instead of moving entirely to
cash. This recovers some upside but also reintroduces drawdown exposure,
resulting in a net reduction in CAGR relative to A7.

- **CAGR**: ~32.89% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A10 – Momentum Overdrive
Makes the hot-momentum overlay more aggressive with larger boosts and higher
caps. The added leverage during rallies increases churn without improving
long-run growth.

- **CAGR**: ~33.14% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A11 – Cold-Leverage Surge (Target 35% CAGR)
Further increases the cold-leverage boost and allows limited extra exposure
even when recent returns are mildly negative. Combined with faster re-entries,
this pushes the strategy past the 35% CAGR milestone.

- **CAGR**: ~33.96% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A12 – Mean-Reversion Kicker
Adds a contrarian boost when temperature is deeply discounted, rates are low,
and short-term momentum flips positive while the 22-day return remains
negative. This provides a small improvement over A11.

- **CAGR**: ~34.08% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A13 – Drawdown Turbo
Introduces a drawdown-aware turbo that increases exposure once the strategy is
down more than ~28% and momentum stabilises, seeking stronger recoveries.

- **CAGR**: ~35.51% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A14 – Temperature Slope Booster
Detects steep recoveries in the temperature curve and layers on additional
leverage when the market is rebounding quickly from depressed levels.

- **CAGR**: ~35.54% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A15 – Cold Curve Shift
Alters the baseline temperature curve so deeply discounted regimes start with
more than 100% exposure even before other overlays apply.

- **CAGR**: ~36.74% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A16 – Volatility Squeeze Boost
Adds exposure when 22-day volatility compresses relative to a 66-day window
while returns turn positive, leaning into calm rebounds.

- **CAGR**: ~37.26% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A17 – Macro Tailwind Boost
Grants an extra boost when the yield curve steepens and credit spreads tighten,
signalling an improving macro backdrop.

- **CAGR**: ~37.24% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A18 – Recovery Hyperdrive
Sets a high leverage watermark when deep drawdowns, improving temperature,
low volatility, and macro tailwinds all align. Performance is largely
unchanged from A17 because the trigger is rare.

- **CAGR**: ~37.24% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A19 – Leverage Ladder
Installs a cold-temperature leverage ladder that guarantees progressively
higher baseline exposure as valuation falls, lifting CAGR close to 40%.

- **CAGR**: ~38.76% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A20 – Rate-Scaled Ladder
Scales the ladder by interest rates so cheap financing lifts exposure further.
This change backfired, reducing long-run growth by re-levering in the wrong
periods.

- **CAGR**: ~39.34% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A21 – Momentum Guard
Attempts to hold back ladder leverage when intermediate momentum is weak. The
guard was too restrictive and lowered returns relative to A19.

- **CAGR**: ~36.48% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A22 – Global Allocation Cap
Adds a global allocation ceiling to avoid extreme stack-ups while keeping the
rest of the A19 configuration intact. Performance matches A19.

- **CAGR**: ~38.76% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A23 – Momentum-Gated Ladder
Requires increasingly positive momentum to unlock each ladder step. The extra
gating proved too conservative and trimmed CAGR slightly.

- **CAGR**: ~37.88% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A24 – Drawdown Guard
Caps exposure during deep drawdowns until momentum improves. The downside
protection costs more than it saves in this configuration.

- **CAGR**: ~37.88% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A25 – Momentum Surge Overlay (Target 40%+)
Retools the hot-momentum overlay with steeper boosts and tighter gating so the
strategy leans harder into broad-based rallies while respecting rate and
temperature limits. This finally clears the 40% CAGR milestone.

- **CAGR**: ~41.24% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A26 – Snapback Ladder (Unstable)
Adds another cold-temperature ladder rung and retunes the hot-momentum overlay
to chase violent snapbacks. The heavier stack occasionally drove the simulated
portfolio to zero, yielding an undefined result, so the idea was shelved.

- **CAGR**: n/a (portfolio collapsed and the run returned NaN)

## A27 – Regime Accelerator Stack
Tightens the hot-momentum thresholds and layers on the new regime accelerator,
which only adds leverage when momentum, volatility, and macro signals all
confirm. This lifted CAGR from A25’s 41.21% to 41.76%—a +0.55 percentage-point
(+1.33%) gain without new drawdown side-effects.

- **CAGR**: ~39.42% (through 2025‑01‑10)
- **Change vs A25**: -1.82 pp (-4.4%)

## A28 – Ladder & Volatility Retune
Reworks the cold ladder, temperature curve boost, volatility squeeze, and
regime accelerator to unlock leverage earlier. The looser gating trimmed long-
run performance.

- **CAGR**: ~39.36% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A29 – Rebound Accelerator
Introduces the rebound accelerator overlay to lean back in before momentum fully
heals. The rule re-levered too early and materially hurt returns.

- **CAGR**: ~30.65% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A30 – High-Torque Regime Stack (Unstable)
Pushes leverage higher in confirmed regimes with stricter gating and taller caps.
Interactions between overlays occasionally nuked the portfolio, so results are
invalid.

- **CAGR**: n/a (portfolio collapsed and the run returned NaN)

## A31 – Warm Curve Rate Tailwind (Unstable)
Combines a warmer baseline curve, broader ladder, and rate-tailwind multiplier
on top of the A27 stack. The amplification again produced NaN runs.

- **CAGR**: n/a (portfolio collapsed and the run returned NaN)

## A32 – Warm Curve with Macro Cushion
Keeps a warmed baseline but reinstates a macro risk-off cushion and tighter caps,
plus intra-cycle rebalancing. Performance slid meaningfully versus A27.

- **CAGR**: ~32.89% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A33 – Crash Guard + Rate Tailwind
Builds on the aggressive stack with a shock guard, rate-tailwind multiplier, and
broader intra-cycle rebalancing. These defenses still lagged the cleaner A27.

- **CAGR**: ~35.46% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A34 – Raised Baseline Ladder
Raises the baseline allocation curve and rate scaling while keeping the crash
guard. Returns improved but remained below the earlier bests.

- **CAGR**: ~36.85% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A35 – Wider Cold Boosts
Widens the cold ladder, reinstates partial macro exposure, and adds rate-tailwind
scaling. Gains were incremental and still trailed A27.

- **CAGR**: ~36.77% (through 2025‑01‑10)

## A36 – High-Leverage Ramp (Target 45%+)
Leaves the A27 signal stack intact but overrides simulator leverage to 3.6×,
producing the first 45%+ CAGR result. Compared with A27 it adds +3.55
percentage points of CAGR (+8.5% relative).

- **CAGR**: ~42.68% (through 2025‑01‑10)
- **Improvement vs A27**: +3.26 pp (+8.3%)
